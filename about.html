  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Since childhood, dance has been my heartbeat. I am <strong>Moupia</strong>, 
    a passionate <em>dancer</em> and <em>model</em>, whose journey began with 
    the rhythms of Indian classical art forms. What started as simple steps 
    soon grew into a lifelong devotion to movement and expression.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the years, I trained in <strong>Bharatnatyam</strong> and <strong>Odissi</strong>, 
    two of India’s most profound classical dance traditions. Along the way, 
    I embraced the joy of <strong>folk dances</strong> and the creativity of 
    <strong>contemporary styles</strong>, blending tradition with modern expression.  
    For me, dance is not just performance — it is a story written in gestures, 
    rhythm, and emotion.
  </p>
  <p>
    My journey as a <strong>model</strong> began as an extension of my love for art.  
    Modeling taught me how grace, discipline, and expression can exist not only 
    on stage but also in front of the camera. Each pose is like a still performance, 
    capturing confidence, elegance, and emotion in a single frame.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, I stand at the crossroads of both worlds — dance and modeling — 
    carrying forward a dream to inspire and connect with people through art.  
    Whether it is through the powerful storytelling of a classical performance, 
    the vibrance of folk, or the creativity of a photoshoot, my goal is to share 
    beauty, culture, and inspiration with everyone I meet.
