Welcome to my creative world! I am Moupia Dutta, a passionate dancer and model blending tradition with modern expression. Explore my journey through art, rhythm, and elegance.

About Me

Dance has been my heartbeat since childhood. I trained in Bharatnatyam and Odissi, two of Indiaâ€™s most profound classical dance forms, and later embraced folk and contemporary styles. Dance is my way of storytelling â€” expressing emotions, culture, and beauty through movement
Modeling became a natural extension of my artistic journey. Each photoshoot and ramp walk allows me to capture confidence, elegance, and creativity in a single frame.

Today, I combine dance and modeling to inspire, connect, and share my passion with the world.
